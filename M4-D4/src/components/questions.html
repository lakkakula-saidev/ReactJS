    <h2>Improve your Bookstore!</h2>

    <h4>In this exercise you are gonna update your own book store!</h4>

    <h4>
      Start from your previous React book store. We want you to give the user
      the ability to add comments to the books. All users can add comments like
      a "real" review :)
    </h4>

    <pre>      <code>
        API INFO:

        You have a CRUD endpoint for comments on:

        https://striveschool-api.herokuapp.com/api/comments/

        This means you can GET, DELETE, POST, PUT data from there.

        The Comment structure is this:

        {
          "comment": "A good book but definitely I don't like many parts of the plot",
          "rate": 3,
          "elementId": "0316438960"
        }

        Where:
        - comment is the text of comment inserted by the user
        - rate is a value between 1 and 5
        - elementId is the ASIN of the book
        - use usual Authentication (grab a new token on https://strive.school/studentlogin if you're previous one is expired)

        !IMPORTANT!
        You can't get ALL the comments. You have to specify the ElementID / ASIN in the query:

        https://striveschool-api.herokuapp.com/api/comments/{ASIN}

        Doing so, you'll get all the comments for that specific book.

      </code>
    </pre>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Create a CommentArea component. When the user clicks on a book, this
        component should be displayed.
      </li>
      <li>
        CommentArea component contains the picture of the book, and two
        subcomponents: CommentsList and AddComment.
      </li>
      <li>
        CommentsList holds a list of comments about the selected book, the
        comments array is passed as a prop. Each comment is made by the same
        SingleComment component.
      </li>
      <li>
        AddComment contains a form for adding a text comment and a rating (from
        1 to 5). This component should allow the user to POST a new Comment on
        the selected Book
      </li>
      <li>
        Add, to each "Comment", a button for DELETING it. Create a request
        towards https://striveschool-api.herokuapp.com/api/comments/{commentId}
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a Loading component. This loading component should appear on the
        page when an remote request is ongoing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create an error handler for the remote requests. If something goes
        wrong, an error message should appear!
      </li>
      <li>Publish everything on GitHub</li>

      <!-- EXTRA -->
      <li>
        Add to CommentList component the ability to filter comments using a text
        box. The filter will display only the comments that contain the
        specified string in the text or in the author properties.
      </li>
    </ol>
