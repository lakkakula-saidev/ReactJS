    <h2>Strivestaurant</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Transform DishComments functional component into a class based one.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the ReservationForm component make the Form actually visible just
        after clicking on the h2 above it (use the component state!).
      </li>
      <li>
        Change MyNavBar component in a class-based one; create a constructor and
        log a message in the console as the component initializes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the DishComments component use the ternary operator to show a piece
        of text instead of the ListGroup if the dish prop is a falsy value.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the Home component, hide the DishComments component with a
        short-circuit operator if the selected dish name is "Amatriciana".
      </li>
      <li>
        In the Home component, show an Alert component instead of the
        ReservationForm if even a single a comment of the selected dish has a
        rating below 5.
      </li>
      <li>
        In Home.jsx give a "header" prop to the Reservations component. If
        present, this component should display it instead of the generic
        'RESERVATIONS' in its h3.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the Home component use a ternary operator to replace the text inside
        the h1 and the p tags above the carousel with the values of the props
        "newTitle" and "newPayoff" respectively, if present.
      </li>
      <li>
        Change the "Strive for food" text in the MyNavBar component to "The
        perfect place for pasta lovers" if the prop title has a value of
        "Strivestaurant".
      </li>
    </ol>
